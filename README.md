# Train-Scheduler
This assignment introduced students to the moment.js library and challenged them to create an application utilizing its methods and the firebase database. The task was to create a train scheduler application that would allow users to determine when a train would be arriving and how far away in minutes it was based on the information provided from the user in the input fields. The firebase database is used to store user information and to provide real time data if the user revisits the site.
